# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Tool

Twitter is a platform where most of the people express their feelings towards the current context. As humans, we can guess the sentiment of a sentence whether it is positive or negative. Similarly, we also train and develop a simple Twitter Sentiment Analysis supervised learning model using python and NLP libraries.
An accuracy of 0.93837 is obtained for the simple pipeline model. Note that there are chances to improve this accuracy by tuning parameters using GridSearchCV and other preprocessing techniques.
